Task:
Design an LLM agent that successfully does the following task:
    1. Looks up the pages for homicide statistics for the cities of New York, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.
    2. Extracts the homicide numbers for each year for the past 5 years.
    3. Dumps them in a structured table.
    You may give the agent extremely specific instructions if necessary. 

Send the code and a short writeup of your findings.

Thinking:
Most large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have a knowledge cutoff date, which means they are not aware of any 
events or data beyond a certain point. And most of large language models themselves don't have ability to search 
web in real-time, but required to equip with web browsing capabilities so they can retrieve up-to-date information
beyond it's training data, including recent news, live statistics.

For this task, user can interact with the LLM agent with natural language, and the LLM can extracts useflu
information from web in real time based on user's prompt. Then LLM cann dump the extracted data into a structured
table.

Implementation:
Step 1: Make LLM have the capabilities to browse website in real time.
Step 2: Use tools like Web crawler to extract information from web.
Step 3: Dump results into a structured table.
