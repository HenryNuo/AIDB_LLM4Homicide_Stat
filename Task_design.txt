Task:
Design an LLM agent that successfully does the following task:
    1. Looks up the pages for homicide statistics for the cities of New York, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.
    2. Extracts the homicide numbers for each year for the past 5 years.
    3. Dumps them in a structured table.
    You may give the agent extremely specific instructions if necessary. 

Send the code and a short writeup of your findings.

Thinking:
Traditional database need to write search query to finish look up tasks. Even for a database with GUI, user also
need to enter value or select options from a drop down list as a input of a "filter" which can be treat as the 
front-end implementation of a search query.

For this task, user can interact with the LLM agent with natural language, and the LLM can extracts useflu
information from user's prompt, then generate a search query into database, so that user can search data with
natural laguage instead of writing code like SQL.

Implementation:
Step 1: Search useful urls that contain homicide data.
Step 2: Use tools like Web crawler to form web data into a database. ??
Step 3: Implement a ChatGPT agent that can generate search query based on user's prompt. 
Step 4: Feed query into database and get the result.
Step 5: Dump result into a structured table.
